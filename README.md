# PUCRS BS Degree

I went to Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) to pursue a Bachelor of Science degree. I initially started in Computer Engineering, then switched to Software Engineering, where I completed my degree. I studied from 2016 to 2023 — seven years full of fun and a lot of exciting subjects.

I had to study and work at the same time, so this repostory aims to track all my class assignments that I managed to keep record of.

When possible I'll provide the context for what I was coding as a way to run using `nix-shell`, if you want to try it yourself.

## Structure

Each folder should manage itself and have the following files: `README.md`, `shell.nix` and a `.gitignore`.
