# Systems Security – Assignment 1: Cryptanalysis

**Prof. Avelino Zorzo**

**Polytechnic School – PUCRS**

### Objective
For the first assignment in this course, the goal is to create a program that, given an encrypted text, recovers the original plaintext.

### Tasks
1. **Determine the Key Length**
   - The first step is to discover the length of the key used to encrypt the plaintext.
   - You may use one of the following methods:
     - **Kasiski Test**
     - **Index of Coincidence**

2. **Language Identification**
   - The text may be in **Portuguese or English**.
   - Letter frequency tables for these languages can be found at:
     - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency)

### Deliverables
- **A 2-page report** explaining:
  - The cryptanalysis approach used.
  - Part of the ciphertext and its corresponding plaintext.
- **Source code** (in any programming language).
- The report must follow the **ACM, IEEE, or SBC article format**.

### Submission
- Submit the **source code** and **report** via **Moodle**.

### Grading Criteria (10 points total)
- **Automatic key length calculation algorithm** (2 points).
- **Algorithm for decrypting the text** (2 points).
- **Complete working solution** (2 points).
- **Report** (well-written, in the required format) (2 points).
- **Code quality** (2 points).

### GOOD LUCK!
