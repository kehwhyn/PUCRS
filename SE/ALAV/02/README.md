# Additional recursion exercises

Model the recursions, and then implement each of the modeled algorithms.
Create a class containing the implemented methods. Place the modeling as a comment before each method.

How we will work: programming in pairs during our synchronous meeting (Pair Programming), meaning one machine/code, two developers cooperating, alternating the roles of pilot and co-pilot (every 10â€“15 minutes, for example). After the meeting, continue developing cooperatively using the GitHub repository to share the work being developed.

Extra: once these exercises are finished, model and implement (if not already completed) the warm-up exercises.


The exercises:

1. Model and implement a recursive method that calculates the factorial of a number `n` passed as a parameter.

1. Model and implement a recursive method that calculates the summation of a number `n` (passed as a parameter) down to 0.

1. Model and implement a recursive method that calculates the n-th number in the Fibonacci sequence.

1. Model and implement a recursive method that calculates the summation of the integers between numbers `k` and `j`, passed as parameters.

1. Model and implement a recursive method that receives a `String` and returns `true` if this string is a palindrome, or `false` otherwise.
    ```
         boolean isPal(String s)
    ```
1. Model and implement a recursive method that receives a zero or positive integer and returns a `String` with the binary representation of the number.
    ```
         String convBase2(int n)
    ```
1. Model and implement a recursive method that calculates the summation of the numbers contained in an `ArrayList` of integers, passed as a parameter.

1. Model and implement a recursive method to find the largest element in an `ArrayList`.
    ```
         int findBiggest(ArrayList<Integer> ar)
    ```

1. Implement a recursive method to determine whether a string occurs within another.
    ```
         boolean findSubStr(String str, String match)
    ```
1. Create a recursive method that determines the number of digits in an integer.
    ```
         int nroDigit(int n)
    ```
1. Implement a method that receives a `String` and returns an `ArrayList` with all permutations of this string.
    ```
         ArrayList<String> permutations(String s)
    ```
